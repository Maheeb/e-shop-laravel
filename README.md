## About this project
This is an e-shop made with laravel. I have tried to use all the popular and common used features of laravel such as relationship, authentication system, seeder , accessor, scope , sessions and so on. Like other e-shop a user can add product to cart here and then check out. There is a small admin panel from where an admin can add products.
